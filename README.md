# Machine Learning Students Association Workshops

The Python notebooks that accompany the MLSA workshops.

This is the first time (August, 2018) that any of these workshops have ever been run; most of them haven't been uploaded yet (and even those that have a are still in a state of flux). We're expecting the workshops to stabilise as we actually deliver them over the next few months.

* **workshop-SL02**, Classification
* **workshop-SL03**, Regression

### Deep Learning
* **workshop-DL01**, Deep Neural Networks
* **workshop-DL02**, Convolutional Neural Networks
* **workshop-DL03**, Recurrent Neural Networks

### Reinforcement Learning

* **workshop-RL02**, Policy-Based (Policy Gradient)
* **workshop-RL03**, Value-Based (Deep Q-Networks)
* **workshop-RL04**, Policy & Value-Based (A3C)
