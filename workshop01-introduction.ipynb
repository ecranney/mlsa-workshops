    "**An example**. Take, for example, an enrollment list for a subject. In this case, each student (corresponding to a row in our list) constitutes an *object*. The *features* that we record for each student might be (for example) \"StudentID\", \"Name\", \"AssignmentMark1\", \"AssignmentMark2\", \"ExamMark\", and \"Passed/Failed\". The values for these features for any given student would constitute the *data* for that student. In this case, let's say that \"Passed/Failed\" is the thing that we want to predict, then \"PassedFailed\" would become our *label*. We could construct some kind of model that takes in a student's \"AssignmentMark1\" and \"AssignmentMark2\" and predicts whether they pass or fail the subject. This could then be used on next-year's student cohort to identify any students in danger of failing."

    "\n",
    "1. **Cleaning** your data;\n",
    "2. **Exploring** your data for interesting patterns;\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering** to generate new informative features for the data;\n",

    "5. **Explaining** your model (that is, why it works well or poorly).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is obviously a pretty naive workflow, but it gives you a bit of a sense of where to start. In practice, there's a lot of back-and-forth between the steps (especially 2, 3, and 4)."

    "## 1. Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first get your data, you'll usually find that it's \"unclean\" - that is, not yet suitable to be used in any of our models. This will typically be because there are **missing values**, **anomalously extreme values (outliers)**, or because the **data is non-numeric**. Cleaning means dealing with each of these issues.\n",

    "### Initial Exploration\n",
    "After importing `pandas`, it's good practice to check that everything's been read in correctly, then mess around with it a little to get a sense of what features you have, and how they might be related to the label.\n",

    "* **Supervised Learning**. Given set of input variables, X (features), with corresponding output variables y (labels), come up with some kind of function that maps X to y. For example, you might be given a data set of people's ages, weights, and heights (the features), and their associated sexes (the labels); under a supervised learning paradigm, we try to build a model trys to predict a person's sex given their age, weight, and height.\n",
    "* **Unsupervised Learning**. Given a set of input variables, X, learn the underlying distribution of the data. \"Learning the underlying distribution\" of the data is a fancy way of saying \"find records that are either similar to or associated with each other\" in some way. Notice that this sounds a lot more open-ended than supervised learning. That's mainly because - in this case - we're not given any notion of \"truth\" (i.e. a label) that we're trying to guess at. It's our job to actually discover patterns in the data.\n",
